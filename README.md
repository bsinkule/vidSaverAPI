## vidSaver lets the user save YouTube videos on their device with local storage, so the user does not need an account or any type of login to save the videos.

## The user just pastes a valid YouTube URL into the input field on the top, then either presses "enter" or click "add vid" to add the video to the page.

## The user can click "clear all" to remove all videos from the page.

## The user can click "random vid" and a random YouTube video will be loaded to the page. The random videos will not be saved to the device, so when the page is refreshed, there will still be the saved videos from "add vid" and the random videos will be deleted.

## The "info" button can be clicked to see the information about the site.
